I can only reproduce this bug on certain devices!
- iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 17.3.1
- M1 Macbook Air running macOS 14.3.1
- __not__ iPad
- __not__ simulators

1. Run the app
2. scroll up and down, see that it works nicely
3. tap the text field
4. press Return to unfocus the text field
5. try to scroll up and down again

Result: the scrollable area jumps all around
